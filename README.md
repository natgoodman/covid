<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->
A collection of R scripts and documents analyzing Covid-19 data sources, focusing on Washington state where I live.

**THE SOFTWARE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. THE CODE IS ROUGH and SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION NONEXISTENT. MUCH OF THE CODE DOESN'T WORK!! PLEASE GET IN TOUCH IF YOU NEED HELP**

Installation and Usage
----------------------

The software is **not a package** and cannot be installed by `devtools::install_github` or related. Sorry. The simplest way to get the software is to download or clone the entire repo.

More TBD.

Comments Please!
----------------

Please post comments on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gnatgoodman) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nathan.goodman.3367), or contact me by email <natg@shore.net>.

Please report bugs, other software problems, and feature requests using the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/natgoodman/frecl/issues). I will be notified, and you'll be apprised of progress. As already noted, the software is still rough and software documentation nonexistent.
