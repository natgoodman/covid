*In the 12 months ending October 24, 2021, COVID deaths in the United States were 18% of expected deaths from all non-COVID causes; in Washington State, COVID deaths were 11% of expected non-COVID deaths. In both locations, COVID was the third leading cause of death behind heart disease and cancer. In Washington State, among age groups 35 years and up, COVID deaths were 9-15% of expected non-COVID deaths (15% in the youngest group decreasing to 9% in the oldest); it was the third leading cause of death in age groups from 35-79 years old, and fourth leading cause in those 80+ years old. In young adults (20-34 years old), COVID deaths were 6% of expected non-COVID mortality and the fourth leading cause of death. In children and teens (0-19 years old), COVID deaths were 2% of expected non-COVID mortality and the sixth leading cause of death. See below for [caveats](#caveats) and [technical details](#techdetails).*

The gruesome body count of COVID deaths is mind-numbing. Unless you've lost a loved one to COVID, it's hard to grasp the enormity of the 700,000 deaths reported in the New York Times on October 1, a number that's grown to almost 750,000 as I write this. For those old enough to remember the Vietnam war, it brings to mind the body counts reported daily to mark "progress" in that horror. For comparison, the official US death toll in the Vietnam war was 58,220; Vietnamese deaths probably exceeded 1,000,000.

In this blog post, I try to put the COVID death toll in context by comparing annual COVID deaths to expected non-COVID mortality and to other leading causes of death. I report on deaths for all ages in the United States and Washington State where I live, and deaths by age group in Washington State. See below for [data sources](#sources), [caveats](#caveats) and [technical details](#techdetails).

The first block of figures (Figures 1a-2b) set the stage. The meat begins with the next block (Figures 3a-b).

The top row (Figures 1a-b) shows cumulative COVID deaths per million in the USA and Washington State. The bottom row (Figures 2a-b) annualizes the data so we can compare COVID deaths to annual mortality data. The left column (the 'a' figures) show all ages in the two locations. The right column (the 'b' figures) break it down by age group in Washington State. 

```{r out.width="50%",echo=FALSE,fig.show='asis',include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figdir,'figure_001a_jhu_cum.png'));
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figdir,'figure_001b_doh_cum.png'));
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figdir,'figure_002a_jhu_ann.png'));
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figdir,'figure_002b_doh_ann.png'));
```

The main points of note are

1. COVID deaths vary by location and age. The death rate is much higher in the USA as a whole than in Washington State. Within Washington State (and presumably all other states), the elderly (80+ years old) suffer many more deaths than the young.
2. Annual COVID deaths fluctuate reflecting the several COVID waves we've endured. In the all-age graph (Figure 2a), the annual death rate has increased 1.8x in the USA and somewhat less in Washington State between early Summer 2020 and Spring 2021; in the USA, the annual rate has dropped abut 5% from the Spring 2021 peak, while in Washington State, the rate has increased about 20%. The current annual death rates are about 1550 per million (USA) and 800 per million (Washington).

The next figures (Figures 3a-b) show annual COVID deaths relative to non-COVID deaths.

```{r out.width="50%",echo=FALSE,fig.show='asis',include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figdir,'figure_003a_jhu_mort.png'));
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figdir,'figure_003b_doh_mort.png'));
```

For the all-age case (Figure 3a), this is just a simple scaling and doesn't change the shape of the graph. For the age-group data (Figure 3b), the change is dramatic. The oldest group (80+ years) is now in the middle of the pack. The most affected groups are now middle aged adults (35-49 years), followed by pre-seniors (50-64 years), and then young seniors (65-79 years). Young adults (20-34 years) and children and teens (0-19 years) remain thankfully near the bottom but have moved much closer to the older groups.

The reason for the big change in the age-group figure is that expected mortality is much lower in younger groups making COVID deaths a bigger fraction of the total. 

Reading off the final values from the graphs (actually from the data behind the graphs), we get the following numbers: 

<!-- <center><div style="width: 40%"> -->
<div style="width: 45%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
k1=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_001_mort_pct.kbl'))
k1
```
</div>
<!-- </center></div> -->

The geographic disparity is clear: USA 18% vs. Washington State (all ages) 11%. The age disparity is also clear: 2% in children and teens (0-19 years), rising to 6% in young adults (20-34 years), rising further to 15% in middle aged adults (35-49 years), then falling group by group to 9% in the eldery (80+ years).

Relative mortality captures the sense that while all deaths are sad, deaths in young people are more tragic. Sayings like, "Cut down in their prime", and "Outlived their children" express the grief we feel when people die before their time. By this measure, COVID's impact on adults 35-79 years old is greater than in the elderly (80+ years), even though the absolute death rate is much higher in the elderly.

The tables below gives further context for these numbers by comparing annual COVID deaths to the leading non-COVID causes of death. The first two tables show results for the USA as a whole and Washington State all ages.

<div style="width: 65%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
k1=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_002a_jhu_usa.kbl'))
k2=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_002b_jhu_state.kbl'))
kables(list(k1,space,k2))
```
</div>

COVID is the third leading cause of death in the USA as a whole, killing almost as many people as cancer and far more than the next three causes (accidents, lung disease, and stroke). COVID is also the third leading cause of death in Washington State all ages but sits well below the top tow causes (cancer and heart disease) and well above the next three (Alzheimer's disease, accidents, and lung disease).

<!--- <div style="width: 90%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> --->
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
k1=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_003a_doh_0_19.kbl'))
k2=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_003b_doh_20_34.kbl'))
k3=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_003c_doh_35_49.kbl'))
kables(list(k1,space,k2,space,k3))
k1=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_003d_doh_50_64.kbl'))
k2=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_003e_doh_65_79.kbl'))
k3=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_003f_doh_80_.kbl'))
kables(list(k1,space,k2,space,k3))
```
<!--- </div> --->

The next tables show results for Washington State by age group.

Among children and teens in Washington State (0-19 years), COVID thankfully remains below the five leading causes of death. It climbs to fourth place in the next age group (young adults, ages 20-34 years) where it kills almost as many people as cancer and more than homicide and heart disease. COVID is the third leading killer for the next three age groups (35-49, 50-64, and 65-79 years). In the elderly (80+ years), the death rates are much higher for all leading causes; in this group, Alzheimer's disease overtakes COVID which sits as the fourth leading cause of death.

COVID is a major killer of adults of all ages. It kills almost as many people as cancer in adults 20-49 years old, almost as many as heart disease in adults 50-79 years old, and almost as many as Alzheimer's disease in adults 80+ years old. 

I hope that placing COVID in the context of these other common, dreaded diseases will make the enormous COVID death toll more concrete.
