*TBD Counts of cases, hospital admissions, and deaths are key metrics of COVID-19 prevalence and burden, and are the basis for model-based estimates and predictions of these statistics. I present here graphs showing these metrics over time in Washington state and a few other USA locations of interest to me. I update the graphs and this write-up weekly. Previous versions are [here](https://natgoodman.github.io/covid/updatvsn.html). See below for [caveats](#caveats) and [technical details](#techdetails).*



```{r echo=FALSE,include=FALSE,cache=FALSE}
## setup
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
## load data from RData file
load_=function(file) {
  what=load(file=file);                 # what is name of saved data
  get(what);                            # return it
}
doc='mtop';
figdir=file.path('figure',doc);
tbldir=file.path('table',doc);
space=strrep('\\ ',10);                 # space between tables
```


The gruesome body count of COVID deaths is mind-numbing. Sadly reminiscent of the body counts from the Vietname for those old enough to remember.

In this blog post, I try to put the death toll in context by comparing annual COVID deaths to the leading causes of non-COVID deaths. In the USA as a whole COVID kills almost as many people as cancer and far more than accidents. In Washington State, looking at all ages, COVID kills more people than Alzheimer's disease; among the elderly (people 80 years and above), COVID kills more than stroke or lung disease; among young adults (20-24 years old), COVID kills almost as many as cancer and more than homicide or heart disease.

Figures 1a-b show cumulative COVID deaths in the USA and Washington State. 

```{r out.width="50%",echo=FALSE,fig.show='asis',include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figdir,'figure_001a_jhu_cum.png'));
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figdir,'figure_001b_doh_cum.png'));
```

The next two graphs (Figures 2a-b) annualize the data so we can compare COVID deaths to other leading causes of death (usually expressed annually).

```{r out.width="50%",echo=FALSE,fig.show='asis',include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figdir,'figure_002a_jhu_ann.png'));
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figdir,'figure_002b_doh_ann.png'));
```

The next figures (Figures 3a-b) show annual COVID deaths relative to non-COVID deaths.

```{r out.width="50%",echo=FALSE,fig.show='asis',include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figdir,'figure_003a_jhu_mort.png'));
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figdir,'figure_003b_doh_mort.png'));
```


## jhu tables centered
<center>
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
k1=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_001a_jhu_usa.kbl'))
k2=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_001b_jhu_state.kbl'))
kables(list(k1,space,k2))
```
</center>

## jhu tables narrowed, not centered
<div style="width: 67%">
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
k1=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_001a_jhu_usa.kbl'))
k2=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_001b_jhu_state.kbl'))
kables(list(k1,space,k2))
```
</div>


## jhu tables narrowed and centered
<center><div style="width: 67%">
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
k1=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_001a_jhu_usa.kbl'))
k2=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_001b_jhu_state.kbl'))
kables(list(k1,space,k2))
```
</div></center>


## doh tables
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
k1=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_002a_doh_0_19.kbl'))
k2=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_002b_doh_20_34.kbl'))
k3=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_002c_doh_35_49.kbl'))
kables(list(k1,space,k2,space,k3))
k1=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_002d_doh_50_64.kbl'))
k2=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_002e_doh_65_79.kbl'))
k3=load_(file.path(tbldir,'table_002f_doh_80_.kbl'))
kables(list(k1,space,k2,space,k3))
```
